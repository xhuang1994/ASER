sounds good ! let ’ s see , i want .

that's excellent . how have you managed that ?
what other sources of energy do you use ?
well , people from asia to europe all enjoy tea .
yes , i believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . any others ?
sure , i like drinking tea at teahouses .
let's go !
i don ’ t try to lead people . i ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
yes , in most circumstances .
i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
you ’ re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
ok . you haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?
i think it ’ s over five meters long . i can ’ t remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
do you want the truth ?
well , you really didn't do all that well .
to be completely honest , you failed your test .
you can take it in a couple weeks .
yesterday i had a runny nose . now my nose is stuffed up . i have a sore throat . and i ’ m afraid i've got a temperature . i feel terrible .
ah .
thank you very much .
no , don't need , i can do myself .
but you must cook that dinner next time .
things are going well with me .
mike , i don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . i really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
yes , i have booked a room for 24th . it's a double room .
well , now i want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
it's ten after six.we ' re late.but dinner is at six thirty .
i'll call the lost and found office .
do you have the ' the man and the sea ' by ernest hemingway ?
no problem at all . could i have your full name , please ?
we have new room rates , sir . will that be acceptable to you ?
great ! would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
nonsmoking . now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
thank you so much , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you !
certainly , sir .
i'll just go and check it for you , sir .
yes . i bought this sheet here yesterday .
here it is .
that's very kind of you . thank you .
perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .
yes , i am afraid there are not enough outlets .
are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
yes , you did .
weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
so , then why did you speed up ?
here you go . don't do that again .
surely of course .
sure .
i try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
that's basically it .
i know it does , and that's because it is .
could you show me where the chinesc-style clothing is located ? i want to buy a silk coat .
oh , they look nice . may i try that black one on ?
do you have a medium in the same color ? this one is a little tight .
ok . let me try it on . what do you think ?
thanks . how much would that come to ?
great , thanks .
i would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
oh , okay . can i do that right now ?
thank you . i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
yes , i want to send a registered airmail letter to france .
i also want to pack up my package . this is the notes .
oh , one more thing , where can i mail this letter ?
thank you very much .
yeah , i'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . i'm starving !
what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
ok . how about some lamb kebabs ?
i think i'll have a beer .
what would you do without me ?
of course . i've loved writing since i was a very little boy . i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school . after attending nanjing university , i never give up writing . my works , such as father's tobacco pipe , open air cinema , the old city were respectively published china youth daily , yangzi evening news , and new beijing . during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . the impact of internet in chinese political participation , the discipline of remold , the historical direction of chinese administration reform , bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration , beijing due xuebao , theory and society and chinese reform . i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . during this period , i've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , i have full confidence in my writing ability , and i believe i can do the job well .
yes , i'd like to reserve a table for dinner .
six couples .
that sounds like a good idea .
my name is ron kollwitz .
yes , it was quite a long flight . i'm glad to finally be here .
no , but i'll be able to tomorrow .
why don't you ask bill if he can help ?
yes , i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years . i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent .
yes , sir . i acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
yes , i studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .
i can handle them without any trouble
it's a long story . in a word , i didn't do a good job of it . i messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up .
i am trying to find a job asap . lily doesn't know yet . i didn't tell her . i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought i went to work as usual .
yes , i did . but i wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in .
i just don't know how to bring it up . well , all right . she has the right to know anyways .
i've never gotten one . have you ?
really ? what did you get one for ?
where did you park at ?
i ’ m having a problem .
there have been charges made on my debit card that i didn ’ t make .
that sounds absolutely fantastic .
i don't know . can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter ?
i am not cheating . when you pass go , you collect $ 200 , everyone knows that !
banker ?
my goodness ! are you ok ?
how long will you be out of class ?
oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . she is always flushing things down the toilet . you know how kids are .
that would be great ! is it expensive ?
i'm glad to help you . what's wrong ?
i'm sorry to hear it . what's wrong with her ?
you need a babysitter .
i could have suzy stay at my place .
why not ?
i know who we can ask . there is a girl i know , sara ralston.she is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . i know her from my church , and i trust her completely .
i'll get you her number . i hope she can do it . she is very responsible .
i'll go home and get sara's number . i'll call her first myself .
could i have some fruit ?
fine , thank you , and how are you ?
yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . thank you .
not bad . the fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
toilets are in the rear , i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
you are welcome .
you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .
sure . how many would you like ?
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ?
why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
yes , i ordered the express service .
that's fine .
sure . and i'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
would you please fill some gas for me ?
it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
so do i .
i haven't seen her yet .
tell me how she looks .
i believe so .
yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it's necessary .
can i return the car in san francisco ?
really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities .
well , i guess i will have to drive back down then . hmm . i didn't think of that .
yes . it will be fun . driving back down the coast . my girlfriend will like it .
where are the keys ?
sure . just leave it to me . i'll finish it .
speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of seafood in it . they all look very fresh and delicious .
let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
ok . i will wait for you inside the restaurant
i'm going to the hospital .
about how much will it cost ?
it's a quarter to 12 . could you please drive a little faster ?
this is the very thing i've been dreaming of .
sure . do you want it to be registered ?
yes , i will be glad to mail your letter .
alright .
oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time .
yes , maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone.don ' t move that arm while i'm gone . alright ?
it's a good thing that i have choices here . can you tell me about the one on saturday ?
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
that's fine with me . how much time are we going to have to work on this ?
oh , french dressing .
certainly . and what vegetables would you like ?
thank you .
sure . first of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
that ’ s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
no idea . your guess is as good as mine .
well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see .
that's ok .
hello . i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived . i'm from felix wasserman associates .
it's nx567822100007 .
ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
yes . i have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
i need to find out some more information for l / c . i would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .
ok , got it . is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead ?
that sounds fine , thanks for that . let's go ahead !
i believe it happened last night .
it happened at my house .
i'd appreciate that .
come in please .
well , since you have come , do it now please ?
thank you.please get some soap for us .
oh ? what ’ s wrong ?
yes , come in please . i am mr . li . you must be my liu , right ?
well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
yes , of course . you would be responsible for the development of software products .
good . have you got any other questions ?
but i am her brother , not her servant .
maybe you should look around for an outlet .
outlets have more reasonable prices .
the apples are 30nt each . how many would you like ?
they're 250nt each , but they're not edible . they're only used for worship .
wait ! don't go just yet . these bananas are pretty cheap--only 35nt for this bunch .
they're also good for your digestion ! would you like some kiwis , too ?
really ? why ?
but surely they won't fire you ! you're one of the most experienced managers here !
well that's great news ! congratulations ! where will you be located ?
it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
i'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
do you have this shirt in a small ?
may i try it on ?
yes , sir . i apologize for that . here ’ s the file you were looking for , mr . emory .
don't mention it , let's go in .
she sure can . are you jealous , leslie ?
you can ! with a little practice .
exercised over and over . exercise is a key .
good for you , leslie !
ok , how was everything ?
yes , we accept visa and mastercard .
i'm going to quit the job .
thanks for your concern .
just tor three days . i won't need these luggages.couid i put them here ?
well , maybe i can put them in the airport storage there .
that's over on callaway street , isn't it ?
walk that way for about four blocks . the hotel's about two blocks north of there .
better late than never .
for what ? are you taking up painting ?
oh , good . how old is your niece ?
it's a wise thing to do . art will do a child a world of good .
thank you . bye .
yes , a little .
i'm sorry . i can't quite follow you . would you mind speaking slowly ?
i've a driver mate in my car !
yes , it's so helpful .
yes , i'm in a bit of a rush . could i have a piece of apple pie please ?
yes.would tomorrow morning be all right with you ?
i'm afraid he's fully engaged.could you make it another time ?
i would like that . thank you .
no , i haven't got one by now . i will go to the interview of yours .
yes , of course . we could split it . what part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
let's make sure we are on the same page . do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
that would be great . what kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?
that works for me . let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on friday .
scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea .
yeah , i really wanted that chanel bag , too . but just in case you should bid low .
don't count on it , babe . ebay is always full of surprises .
pots and pans are right over there .
but our credit card saves you 10 percent .
here . let me give you an application form .
okay . enjoy your browsing .
i'm allergic to these things , you know .
ok . but just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
oh , my god ! i hope you are all right .
how much school will you miss ?
i appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ’ t be in class . see you next week !
can ’ t complain . and you ?
let me see . i can come out and see you first thing wednesday .
you mean the network connection ?
i have the same question . i can ’ t send out mails . we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
dad , i have to do my homework .
dad , i don't want to talk about it now .
i'm sorry , dad . but i would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
i don't know , but i feel terrible .
do you think i should lie in bed ?
ok . do you think i can play football tomorrow ?
ok , i'll listen to you .
what do you have in mind ?
do you want to know what kind of pie i like ?
there you go . problem solved .
i'll be with you in a minute .
yes . do you exchange foreign money here ?
could you tell me what the exchange rate for usd is today ?
thank you .
my name is steven . i'm the sales manager of this company .
oh , i'm sorry about that .
don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
i'll certainly look into that .
i see . let me show you some samples of various qualities . this one is very nice . it's three hundred and fifty dollars .
yes , i would like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
mostly cassette tapes .
kreng ? i've never heard of that company .
i suppose i don't want that one then . i don't like auto-reverse . it breaks too easily .
yes , twice now . i think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
well . no , i didn't clean it.but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i don't trust auto-reverse .
how much is it ?
thanks .
after following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team .
immediately .
yes , they were . but it has already past . the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan'an aerial road .
that's wonderful . ok . i'll remember that . but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously .
i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better .
i recommend you the white wine . it will wake up your appetite .
wait a minute ! just hold your horses ! what's your hurry , anyway ?
that won't take long .
you wouldn't do a thing like that !
engaged ? she ’ s married .
not a problem . what time shall we call you ?
it'll be our pleasure . we'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
no sooner said than done . can i help you with anything else ?
let me see . laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... oh , that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
suit yourself . don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes . i want to go to beijing hotel .
oh no ! what shall i do ?
thank you very much .
hum ... why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? tomorrow is saturday . i hate all the hustle and bustle of saturday shopping .
hum.maybe it will be better . the most important thing is that i can have a day to relax after a week's work .
by the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . i want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
how tall is this building ?
i ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for trans pacific flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis . could you please make it for the same flight on august 2 instead of july 19 ?
my first name is j-u-d-y , and my last name is w-a-n-g .
it ’ s ok . where should i pay for the penalty ?
thank you !
no , thanks . i ’ m all set . good-bye .
all right . no problem . what ’ s your extension ?
is there anything else ?
how old is he ?
well . i shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . what time does his flight arrive ?
that's everything .
yes , i do . i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd .
yes , i'm good with people .
good .
yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they haven't got one either .
it ’ s still too much . can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ?
i see . can i pay by traveler ’ s checks ?
sure . what do you need ?
well , first you have to turn this switch on .
just a second . i'll go get some .
tell me what the problem is .
do you have some quarters ?
the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
that's all there is .
if you need anything else , just let me know .
yes , do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year ? if i ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you ’ d be different .
i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
that's ok .
first , let's read clause two about packing . it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
certainty.do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
how do you do , jack . nice to meet you .
yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price .
that's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
i see your point . that's to say s 611 each set . still it's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ?
all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set .
i'm not sure.you look familiar .
yes , i have an overall understanding .
then when will i get a reply at the latest ?
but if i don't pass , will you call me ?
then do i have the chance to get this job ?
thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
i'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i don't like to leave things half-done .
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person can't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in deed.the more really close friends i have , the better .
people who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
hello , everybody . i am monica and this is my first day at work . i am working in the finance department . i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you . i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . by the way , call me monica . everybody calls me so .
yes . i was president of the student council of our university .
what's the criteria for staff to attend ? are we only including our management team in this affair ? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
why ?
but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
yes . when can i get them back ?
that's fine . by the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
is your blood pressure , i'm afraid . it's far too high .
you've got to , i'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that's too much for a man of your size .
yes . you've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
usually , i run to the black bamboo park as a warm-up . admission is free . then i start my activities .
no , i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park .
it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .
first , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
do you have an airsickness ?
you'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
we could meet at the real estate office , or i could pick you up at your home .
i can think of five houses that we should look at . it will take most of the day .
here you are .
what do you mean ?
enough is enough . i know .
i'm sorry , mrs . lin . we don't allow smoking in the office .
i want to american breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up .
just put it on the table please .
yeah , we probably should.how much is normal ?
it will leave at 3:00 p . m .
it should be due in at 7:30 a . m.tomorrow .
it is an exhibition of chinese jades . it is held each year . a nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
no problem .
three bags and a suitcase . this is my luggage to check .
thank you !
the 17th will be fine .
hmm , i guess on the 28th .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
i see . have a look at this one . it ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable .
ok , the mirror is over there .
sure , what ’ s up ?
i don ’ t know anything about it . soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
is it anything like american football ?
now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
the material is so abstract that i have trouble understanding it .
by the way , i want a large room .
yes , that's what i am looking for . i will take the room for 2 days .
oh , i don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . you have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . i would love to have
oh , that ’ s great . thanks grace . can you give me her number ? i ’ ll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow . maybe this way i won ’ t be so tired every day , and dan and i might even get to go
what are you excited about ?
was this your first time ?
you ’ re lucky .
you didn ’ t ?
you should be , because you ’ re a part of history .
yes . i want to buy a pair of shoes .
what's that ?
we'll have to get you to a hospital . i can ride you on the back of my bike .
yes , i almost slid too.alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ?
alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop .
well , unfortunately i have got something to do this weekend . but let me see ...
that's very kind of you.how soon do you really need them ?
i'll try .
sorry to hear that . can we do anything about it ?
then i have to call another taxi , or i'll be late .
6 yuan . and i can make them as new as before .
all right . i ’ ll repair them for you .
yes . they will be ready in a few minutes .
that can't be true . i remember the number clearly . is your number 1199886 ?
sorry again for bothering you .
good morning . i ’ m here to see rochelle davis , the human resources manager .
yes , i do . i have a 10:00 appointment with her this morning .
thank you .
oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty .
i have one . we could share it . which way are you going ?
i am going there , too . we can walk together .
how about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? it was painted by a famous chinese painter in king dynasty .
yes , it's $ 167 .
it looks wonderful . very authentic .
ok . so , what can you recommend ?
is it salty ?
what does ' duppa del giono ' mean ? i'm sorry i don't know how to pronounce that .
no . i'll try them . sounds good .
anything you would like to know ?
yes , actually i ’ m looking to buy a camera .
actually i ’ m buying a camera for my husband .
the canon eos . yeah it ’ s ok , but i ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
no you ’ re not ! there are some right here !
thanks for your help , ralph !
please , where do i catch the plane for new york ?
that one there ?
thank you . you ' ve been very helpful .
that ’ s certainly true . but , that ’ s what this job is all about , maria . there's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
all right , maria . i ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it .
you do ? how are you going to contact him ?
what does it say ? do you think he'll see it ?
can i spy on you guys from the window ?
no , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a no . 50 .
one dollar .
sure .
no , a no . 50 will take you right there .
the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
yes . we ’ ve taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious .
yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
sure , go ahead .
what ’ s wrong with that ? cigarette is the thing i go crazy for .
well , your word overrules the file , sir . one moment , please .
sir , i deleted the $ 10 , but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
please don't blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer .
if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
how nice of him . i'll be delighted to go . but what time would be convenient ?
that's great . it's most thoughtful of you to do this , miss rose .
goodbye and see you tonight . miss rose .
ok , i'll tell him .
yes , of course . here it is .
no , some of them are my friend's . do you want her passport , too ?
do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
ok . just a moment . it's just some clothes and toiletries .
i think there is nothing .
yes ?
oh , did you ?
yes , of course.will you come with the receipt ?
until 8 o'clock , ma'am . we are looking forward to seeing you .
no idea . your guess is as good as mine .
well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see .
why , do we need groceries ?
do you know what to get ?
why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
why don't you just get the basics ?
sure , no problem .
since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract .
yes , i got it . thanks .
ok , here you are .
i was unable to make it .
is that right . who ended up winning ?
i wish i was free that night . i'm kind of mad that i didn't go .
what was the score at the end of the game ?
the next game , i will definitely be there .
i've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
what's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
i can't agree more . that's why i only do street shopping .
that's a good idea .
it is 15 minutes ’ drive .
yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
yes , at the end of the hall .
good morning , i have an appointment with mr . johnson at 10:00
yes . that ’ s right .
well , i ’ ll wait .
thank you . coffee , please .
thank you very much .
i need to report a break-in .
please hurry .
you don't need to introduce yourself , yang . you're famous .
ok , ok !
uh , oh , sure . well , i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
no problem , if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .
mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? belgium ?
yes , very interesting flavors ... slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
haggis ? what ’ s haggis ?
yes , we are just looking for one . what's the charge per day ?
that's reasonable .
oh , yes . i remember .
monica , wait a moment . i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .
i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
other company rules also need your attention .
don ’ t mention it .
when did you finish ?
did you mail us your last continued claim form ?
it can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
you can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . if you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
i'm ready when you are , sir .
sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
okay , sir . but don't take too long . you only have 30 minutes .
yes , i know and i like it very much . i will take it .
well , his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . this really got me thinking , and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s .
well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .
of course .
this one is 1500 yuan .
would you like anything else ?
what is that ? it looks like something from a swamp !
you know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
it may take less time , but i don't know about easier . yuck .
i'm sorry i'm late . i overslept . is the manager here today ?
you said it . it won't happen again . do you really think he'd fire me ?
you are probably right . i'll go right now and apologize . i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic .
there is the balance of net liabilities . this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
yes , i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself .
i passed the band two in lpt , but i will try to achieve band one which is the highest level .
yes . i ’ ve lost quite a few pounds since last month .
about two month ago .
what am i suppose to do ?
thank you , doctor . i ’ ll do what you say .
certainly . here it is .
that's right . a german company has invited me for business talks .
just two weeks .
yes , i do .
i will .
yes , please . i ’ m mr . peter , the director of personnel . what can i do for you ?
oh , yes . how do you do , miss wang ? sit down , please .
it's the 11th avenue , park street .

just a minute please . i ’ ll make a call to the hr office . yes , they confirm your appointment . please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . you can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today .
well , as the saying goes – we aim to please !
here are some.they ' re on special sale these days .
i saw a pair of earrings outside your window . can you show them to me ?
i'ii take them . please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
you really should go to rachel's pet store .
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
but it will pose a risk to your health .
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
yes , good luck , maria .
i'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
ok , we wait for you .
what is it ?
yes .
really ? that's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ?
wow ! that's really great news . how often does the magazine come out ?
i'm really looking forward to reading your column .
sure , where would you like to go ?
i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table .
who's the director ?
that's ok . i'll wait until you're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
how much does the magadize cost ?
that's quite expensive . who is their target audience ?
i bet you'll still buy it , though . you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
from a sweet ma ? ! it's not worth it . plus , i'd happily pay more for these things i bought !
ha ! i'm just warming up ! please take me there now !
sure . what do you want to find ?
well , can you be more specific ? there are a lot of websites about that .
o . k . well , go to google.com , and type in “ battle of gettysburg . ”
ok . you ’ d better come back in two hours .
i'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
he's away on a business trip . he won't be back until some time next week .
sure . his cell phone is 09112223 33 . and his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
yes . he usually replies immediately .
my pleasure . i hope you get a hold of him .
yes , i have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
about two month ago .
well , mr . brown , i'm happy to say it's nothing serious .
what am i supposed to do ?
no , thanks . i ’ ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
yes . i ’ ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing , and pear has been falling behind in the market .
no , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
you have ordered a red dress , is that right ?
did i hear about it ? i saw it happen .
i was there .
a man came into the bank with a gun .
i was so scared when i saw the gun .
he took the money and tried to get away .
he didn't even make it out the door .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
well , there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
well , they ’ ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment .
i ’ m sure they are . oh , and a local man won the lottery . i ’ m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i ’ m amazed that i haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . it ’ s so unfair !
yes , i've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . where are they ?
yes , it's yao lan . room 406 .
yes , there is .
yes.may i have some more beer ?
yes , the meal was very delicious and i enjoyed very much . i'm full .
by the way , miss.where is the toilet ?
i attend an aerobic class three times a week .
no , i feel young , fresh and energetic .
why don't you wear a scarf ?
yes . that's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
i'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . do you know all about them ?
well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . have you decided what they are yet ?
i would always be ready to go shopping with you ! should we talk about other basics ?
would you please show me that mural ?
it looks so beautiful . how much is it ?
maybe you are right . ok , i'll take it .
we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . would you like a tour of the house ?
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
ok . what do you think about our living room ?
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
your daughter usually does the dusting , and i do the vacuuming .
that ’ s very nice of you to offer . here ’ s your tea . be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
i feel sorry for you . it's a jungle out there .
well . i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
anything you need to have in the place ?
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
hi , i'd like to order some flowers .
roses will be fine .
why don't you try chinese herbal medicine ?
i need to take a few classes .
i don't understand why i need to make an appointment .
i'd like to make one now if i could .
i'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
that's great . thank you very much .
hello . i would like to speak to your director of human resources , ms.jenkins , please .
this is bill burton from milford insurance , i'm calling in regards to our meeting next tuesday .
no problem .
certainly , doctor . come upstairs .
does he have a temperature , doctor ?
he's in bed , doctor . can you see him , please ? he has a bad cold , too !
what would you like to know , mr . green ?
frankly , some part of it i enjoy very much , but i prefer something more professional . it happens that i have a friend working here in this company . she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . i felt very excited at this news . that's why i'm here .
well , you can have fries-french fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
i'm having my usual . i like the fish here . would you like some wine ?
what's so great about it ?
yeah , you seem to like those styles .
this one looks really expensive though .
lucky you ! i can't buy anything else . i'm flat broke .
why did you drag me into this ? i've spent a week salary .
just joking , tonia . i've got some wonderful clothes . let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
we have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
good idea .
yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
right , i see . let me give you another 500 rib .
do we have to ?
it ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . it gives the room a good atmosphere .
i know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
i know , i know . but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had . all of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
i'm ask for a pizza , please .
you're right , that is great .
tuna sounds good today .
that would be to go .
no problem .
i need some remedies for an upset stomach .
yes , and i also have the runs
when should i take them ?
thank you for your advice .
thank you .
it ’ s at ... gate 14 .
you'll need to make an appointment .
what day would you like us to do the installation ?
i'm sorry . that's the only available time .
yes , it is .
yes , and i hope that it does .
i really love how rain clears the air .
because you can see the stars perfectly .
come with me , please .
yeah , of course . you can take a taxi .
it depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
some are better than others . but , you shouldn't have a problem .
sure . what time do you want to go ?
i'm on a weekly schedule . you're messing everything up .
aright . i'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .
i knew everything would work out for you !
wonderful ! do you already have your work schedule ?
do you know what you will be doing yet ?
hello , yes , i ’ d like to open a bank account .
what what features do they offer ?
i see , well , i think i ’ m more interested in a chequing account . i like to have easy access to my money .
no , that won ’ t be necessary .
yes , i ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars .
sure . do you want to have the car washed ?
you can pick it up in half an hour . by the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ?
i think i will start off in paris . then i ’ m going to take the train to nice and then go on to milan .
oh yes and try lots of new food too .
oh , don ’ t worry , i will !
would you like to ask me anything ?
i think everyone has the right to love who they want .
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ’ clock ?
thank you for calling.goodbye .
all right . which room shall i have ?
mr green , please .
no , thanks . i'll call back later .
ok , thank you.goodbye .
no , there's a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . then there's the ceo — the chief executive officer . he's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it's too dangerous . that's the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . they meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . they provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
we would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . we don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . and you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . does it suit you ?
no problem . we'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
that ’ s out of the question .
tim is .
yes , my whole body feels weak . and i really feel terrible .
what fun ! normally i ’ d love to , but i ’ m afraid i have to work late tonight . we ’ ve got to get the contract ready for miss king .
unfortunately , i just can ’ t make it this time . i have to go straight home . it ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner susan would kill me if i missed it .
yeah , maybe . thanks , anyway . hope you guys have a great time !
not at all . the changing rooms are just this way .
sure . i'll give you the next size up . that one is small , right ?
well.it doesn't go with your skirt . i think the color itself is fine though .
of course ! are you ?
the election is this tuesday .
i ’ m not kidding .
that should ’ ve been something you knew already .
whatever . just make sure you go vote .
we definitely have to talk , zina . and watch your back . elvin is still mad about his nose .
i'm not going to buy one .
i think it's a waste of money .
how is that ?
is that right ?
that sounds nice .
yes , good morning . this is mr . suzuki from video tv . may i speak to mr . johnson ?
uh , yes , okay . tell him john suzuki called . that's s-u-z-u-k-i .
thank you . good-bye .
i'll have ham and egg with french fries . what dessert do you want ?
you can ask the guests for help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
italian , indian and chinese . i ’ ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
not at all.you can find most of them in supermarkets.the ingredients are usually the same as in western food.the way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
obviously , it depends on what i ’ m cooking.but i ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
we just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
if it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
yay !
but i haven't used exercising equipment before . can you tell us some more details ?
working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . what else do you have ?
that's wonderful ! i like swimming .
i've already told my buddy , mark , that i am going hunting with him in alaska .
hey , i've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . i am sorry that bothers you .
says who ? i don't think that is necessarily the case .
whatever you say !
not yet . i don't know how to fill out the form . what is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
if i don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
he is really outrageous .
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i couldn't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?
no way , kate . i mean it's just not my fault .
i am too angry to do that .
let me see . i am sorry we just have sold it out .
i think so . could i have you name , telephone number ? if we get one , i will call you .
i ’ m terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling , like poker . if i did , i ’ d lose all my money .
yes , i do . it ’ s hard to find four players though , so i don ’ t play very often . do you know anyone who plays ? if so , we could set up a game .
sure , i have a friend who play fairly well . we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
sure . the coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . the drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
any idea when he might be back ?
ok . well , tell him i've called , will you , and i'll try again later .
i ’ m in the middle of something right now . i ’ ll be there in a second .
alright , alright . i ’ m coming .
you know what , i have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and i'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .
hey , honey i ’ m back . wow , the house looks really good !
just a sec i ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast
i'd like to talk to somebody about the group account deposit service .
i see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . interesting ...
sure . i strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
may i have a look at your passport , please ?
good morning . i'm interested in antiques . do you have any ?
i'd like porcelain .
oh , it looks well . i like it very much .
that sounds good . but i have a proposal now .
generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements .
you can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database .
sure . what kind of skin do you have ?
then i advise you to buy the lay cleansing milk .
i love this store . the only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .
really ? i thought you hated shopping ?
sure . that ’ s really nice of you . let ’ s go in and try some things on .
that ’ s gorgeous ! do they have it in a size 8 ?
i think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . do they have the same dress in white ?
this is perfect ! what do you think ?
i've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . but the line has been engaged all the time . why is it taking so long ?
ok . please do so if it is not troublesome .
i'm du juan , in room 312 .
thank you for your kindness .
oh , yeah , two beers .
sure , here they are .
no problem . what about this carry-on ?
can i have an aisle seat , pls .
thank you . and when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
thank you very much !
that's all right . but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime ?
mr . smith , i's like to ask you a question .
yes . i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
no . thank you for the time .
besides , internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
just one adult .
i just want to talk to you about the tests that i want to run .
i don ’ t know anything for certain . we always do a double check if there is a question .
you can come in this afternoon . if you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
don ’ t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
yes , i am sure i can .
yes , i think i can in ordinary circumstances .
yes , i think i speak english quite fluently . i got a high score on toefl . i majored in english in college .
thank you for noticing ! i've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .
when i kicked that habit , i found i had so much more energy . i started exercising .
thank you . i ’ m pleased to meet you , mr . brown . my name is kathy pewless , the representative of green textile import and export corporation .
thank you for saying so . have you seen the exhibition halls ? on display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they ’ ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
sure . what do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
ok , well , let's coordinate our efforts . should this party be formal or casual ?
i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?
so , what is most important to you in a job ? do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
would you be able to relocate ?
what are your annual salary requirements ?
i ’ ll keep that in mind . thank you for coming in today . we ’ ll be in touch .
yes , it is . please put your luggage on this scale .
you're looking for a multi though , right ?
okay . then i recommend this one . it's made especially for men about your age .
okay . is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
that's my specialty . let me put this around your neck .
with the cut i'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
okay . say when .
i'm not in the mood .
i don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
cute ? hope so .
me ? no way , keep him away from me , please .
i've said that i've got a problem with the circus . i'm not kidding .
all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
i don't think so . i'll create further achievement in the future .
hi there , everyone . we hope you're having a good night !
the night is young , folks . get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
but for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . get out on that dance floor !
okay . first , go to the next corner and turn left onto center street .
then , walk two more blocks an you ’ ll see city hall on the left . have you got all that ?
oh , really ? that's nice .
this friday ? sorry , i already have plans .
yeah , maybe next time .
sounds like a plan .
it's simple . you can use call transfer .
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and i will not miss any call .
in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
tomorrow morning ? what about tomorrow afternoon ?
ok .
welcome . one of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
you inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
that ’ s not going to be all right .
i ’ m going to have to keep your deposit
because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .
you ’ re not going to get it .
here it is . 350 yuan all together .
hearing you say that is a big reward for us . and here is the receipt .
here is our number . call us when you are ready to come .
yes .
i am sorry , but i can't lend it to you now , for i haven't finished reading it . if you don't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you .
no , it is a fortnightly . so , you see , i can get the new one quite soon .
yes , i do . i also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c
just a minute ... go to this one . i ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
i use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i don ’ t play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program , you
b :: well , i think i'm ready for new challenges .
take it easy . i'll send a larger to pick you up .
i think i'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
yes , yes . everything's fine . thank you very much , becky .
thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?
oh , yeah , maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings .
ok . anything else ?
got it . thanks for reminding me . and , are there any intensive training courses ?
mike , you're late again .
do you think i believe the story like that ?
how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
you'd better .
tickets ? what tickets ?
air tickets ?
we ? the day after tomorrow ? what are you talking about ?
oh , come on . tell me please . why did you book tickets to paris ?
our 10th wedding anniversary ?
darling . i think you have made a mistake .
yes . we married on july 20 ten years ago .
since you have booked . then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
no , thank you . check , please .
here are $ 40 . keep the change . that's my tip for you .
how long will it take to reach the buffet ?
ok . i like that green vegetable but i don't know how to call it .
all right .
yeah , but i'm still waiting for my invitation .
i think so . it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
what time does the party start ?
great . welcome to our company .
thank you , i know where that is .
how about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
oh , don't mention it . it was terrible .
yes , i know . fast food is so popular in this district .
anyway , how was your such , catherine ?
you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america .
i guess you're right . more often than not , people go there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
seriously ?
wow , that's really interesting . so who won ?
wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re-deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders . i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
good idea !
that should be no problem . may i have your full name , please ?
each night will be $ 308 .
wonderful ! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
okay , mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
um yes . i'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
sure , that sounds good .
perfect . thank you . bye ..
hi there . i'm calling about personal internet banking , what details can you give me ?
that sounds good . at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
it depends on the time of year . at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . we also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . we run a very tight operation !
well i think i can afford that apartment . but are pets allowed ?
that's great . that means i can bring my cat , mr . twinkles . where is the apartment located ?
i'd be glad to .
do you have an account with this bank ?
in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application .
not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe .
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
well , i almost always get up very early , and i lift weights for an hour .
no . and then i often go rollerblading .
about five times a week . what about you ?
no , i don't think we have .
mr . smith , please .
what time do you expect him back then ?
no , thanks . i will call back later .
yes , i need some traveler's checks .
three thousand us dollars .
thanks .
are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ?
i will be coming by around 10 this morning . if you aren ’ t there , i ’ ll just use my key .
no time . that's their headlights in the window !
little dude , your life is over !
how's your father ?
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
sure , let me take a look ... personal information , education , experience , training ... i think you should add another section for language . you speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
i need to think it over .
i just stayed at home and watched tv .
yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
if barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
how many more games are left this season ?
of course ! i really love watching football games on tv .
sure , that would be great .
i ’ m fine , thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how about you ?
would you like another bigger one ?
go ahead .
yes , you look very nice .
i'm trying to get my license .
can i do all six hours in one day ?
that's all i have to do ?
well , that's a relief .
yes ? i'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you .
oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ?
it's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ?
i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you .
sorry . i was too worried .
absolutely . by the way , do you sell any traditional chinese medicine ?
i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
how much do you think the rent will be ?
which tooth is it ?
i ’ m afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days .
of course . it's the best one i have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
really ? even for such an excellent one ?
the local newspaper has ads for housing .
sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
sure , i ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
with pleasure .
no problem .
but by then , the technology will be outdated .
i guess you get what you pay for .
last time i tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .
now i'm confused again ! what is the problem ?
well , you can take the no . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
no , just a few minutes .
i ’ m doing well .
could you cancel a check for me ?
yes . thank you .
a glass of qingdao beer .
will you make some recommendation ?
yes , madam . the reporting desk for the british airway's flight to london is over there .
but i'm not sleepy , mum . can i stay and watch more tv ?
i know . but i promise i won't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard .
oh , i nearly forgot the exams .
yeah , i guess so . maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
i know you're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .
oh , yes , please . but you are just closing , aren't you ?
i shall not keep you long then . it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
oh , they were lovely . sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if i remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
oh , you must know the ones i mean . they were on sale , a real bargain . reduced to a quarter of the original price . i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw them .
i don't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
yes , yes , i am sorry i won't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i ’ d have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot .
oh , look ! that was the one there . that is the sort of thing i was looking for . but it's not quite the color .
there it is . that is the pattern ! the set behind you . thank goodness , they haven't been sold . and thank you so much for being so patient with me . yes , those are the ones .
we have the offer ready for you . let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in june . the offer is valid for five days .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
four is an unlucky number here , peter.four sounds like death in chinese.hotels often have no fourth floor .
people don't usually tip here , but you can.fifty dollars should be more enough .
i ’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .
bank of american card . the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
an aisle seat , please . i ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
what time should i arrive at detroit airport ?
what happens if i can ’ t leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
that ’ s ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
well , i ’ ll be glad to help you out . i can come out anytime on tuesday or thursday of next week .
fine . i ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on thursday .
how much would you like to borrow ?
i wouldn't mind having one myself ...
a direct debit service ? what's that exactly ?
but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you .
i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
yes . i ’ m tony . thank you very much .
bye .
of course ! everything at helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn't you shop around ?
no , i don't suppose he's to blame.the man in the other car made a mistake .
yes , sometimes the differences are great .
we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
is that the university next to the teachers ' college ?
you mean we'll share the taxi ?
well.don ' t worry about it , i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
quite good , i think . i came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
i like sports very much.besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time .
it ’ s too loud .
really ? let ’ s go there .
sure ! what do you feel like having ?
i'm not , i am a vegan .
it's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
it wasn't all that great .
i wasn't all that impressed by the food .
the service did not help the situation .
i am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
no . i am a transit passenger going to sweden .
only one night .
no , i don't .
first of all , we need to understand what i was looking for . do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found .
i will take a rain check .
tell me what seems to be the problem .
did you ever talk to him about it ?
i need to take the driver's course . how many hours do i need ?
i need to get my license .
thanks . i'll get back to you .
my luggage is in the corner over there . they are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
and the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
about 50 miles .
no , but we ’ ve got a hurry . it will be the rush hour soon .
wow ! it's a fruit sculpture ! your chef is a real artist !
with the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
give me a big mac , a small order of french fries and a medium coke .
thanks .
miao ping , in your opinion , should we go for the type a or type b account ?
thanks for your time . i'll go and discuss everything with my partner and i'll be back later .
i've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .
may i see your ticket please ?
any form of picture i . d . will do .
that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ?
barely . will you be checking any luggage today ?
i graduated from peking university .
quite often . it is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
you are asking the right person . here are two very important tips . first , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . i can recommend you some online merchants . second , write your mail address correctly . otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time .
not at all . you just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . i will help you with that .
it's important to do proper exercises .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health .
you bet it !
to be reliable is the strong point of our products . as a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .
well , you know , the traffic in beijing is sometimes dangerous . therefore , i have to remind you of something . first , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . finally , remember come on the left and go on the right !
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out , and i'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . last week , i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
go right ahead .
wow , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions .
there are different types . which one do you like best ?
surely , of course .
it's there , near the mirror .
i ’ m going to england by flight be987 .
here you are .
how much must i pay ?
thanks .
i ’ m a little nervous . i ’ ve never flown before .
actually , i'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
thank you .
what is your problem ?
you need not always do that . why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ?
sorry , sir . that table has been booked .
so am i .
how about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
i've gotten chow mein from there before .
trust me , the food isn't half bad .
i think they have pretty good programmes . but i'll change it if you really want .
what's on today ?
did you send in your continued claim form for the last period ?
your check will arrive a little late .
how do you do ?
it's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
thank you . i'm sure i will have a wonderful time here .
oh , yes . mother's day is coming . do you plan to buy anything ?
hmm . in carrefour , clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream .
yes.tell him mr.cook called and ask him to return my call soon as he gets back .
i start work at three .
i get home pretty late , around midnight .
i don't know . i just know i've never been asked so many questions in my life .
i've no idea . oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning .
hmm . thank you very much .
is it ?
may i have a look at the introduction ?
it should be from sayuri beds . is that right ?
perfect . thank you , goodbye !
turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks .
no . it ’ s only five minutes walk . you can ’ t miss it .
great ! i want a three piece suit , preferably made from italian cashmere or wool .
sure . i ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
yes .
i think so . we can go there in the afternoon if you like .
i understand . and where will you be going ?
ok . i'm coming .
thank you . you are so considerate .
ok . this key is too high for me .
thank you . i'm sure you will .
sure , what is the problem ?
i can suggest a product called techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
you can take an antihistamine .
yes , i would like to book a room for my wife and myself .
yes , that would be great . how much is the room ?
does the room have an internet connection ?
hi , susan . what ’ s up ?
i ’ m sorry . i have no idea . i haven ’ t seen that for ages .
no ! my tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . now my engine is on fire !
please . thank you so much for stopping .
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket .
you do ?
i'm akimbo . nice to meet you , i guess .
what kind of deal ?
if you give me cash , do you care if i don't fix the car ?
well , i see . and what about the vacation in our company ?
will our company have some recreational activities ?
$ 60 .
sorry , sir . it's the sale price .
i am afraid not . are there any vacant tables ?
that's all right .
yes . copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
i'd like to have it in big waves .
i'm glad to see you !
yes , i know .
wait , will i have five insurances and one fund ?
it sounds great !
ok .
how long will the induction training be ?
ok .
i'm ready now . i'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
yes , i'd like a glass of iced tea .
i'd love to .
thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
so are we . our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
agreed .
is that right ?
with cold milk ?
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
you probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .
well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
yes . now we are in the olympic stadium , the center of this park .
oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there .
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors .
ok . well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
what was so bad about it ?
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn ’ t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
yes , that ’ s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes that ’ s right . i ’ ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
yes , okay .
yes , i never seem to have any energy .
thank you .
do you have a map of the campus ?
do you know where your classes are ?
that's because you don't know the short cuts . you'll learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes .
i can ’ t wait to vote .
that ’ s right . plus , i agree with his policies .
i ’ m voting for the next president .
i ’ m going to make sure and vote .
yes , i'd like to check out now . my name's adams , room 312 . here's the key .
what's the 14 pounds for ?
here you are .
thank you . goodbye .
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.it ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because i move quickly and i am decisive .
i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.then , i set a timetable that's realistic.what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i've already visualized what could happen and how i'd react .
i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks.the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me.luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
i've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week .
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
do you really think the dalai lama sent that ? i'm tired of all these forwards .
you are not late , mr . thomas . there're still 15 minutes to go . mr . white has just called you .
no , i'd rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today ... what about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste .
i know something about it . our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
is that true ?
i would like to buy some flowers , please . something really nice .
it ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like i ’ m sorry .
i think i ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
i don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . i need something bigger and better !
here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 .
i don't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .
you ’ re right , sir . i apologize . i ’ ll get those files for you now .
i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator .
it's just the job i've been searching for .
have you ever listened to am radio ? it's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on-line .
i can check that for you right now . would you mind holding ?
yes , i have it right here . i'm so sorry about this .
yeah , i just got some good information off the internet .
i didn ’ t just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good .
sure you have to be patient . but i think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
how do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?
is this the one you want ?
it costs $ 200 .
i'm not sure , i feel hot and cold .
i was sick most of the night .
have i got a high fever ?
yes , i have .
aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
all right , thanks .
you can be sure of that , sir .
that's too bad . how much is a new one ?
don't get up so late next time . you should have gone to bed earlier last night .
i don ’ t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
but i just want to give her some tips .
i hope so .
yes . i feel refreshed .
you're right . i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
don't worry about it . tonight is my treat .
no , i insist . i kept telling you that i would treat you to dinner but i still haven't .
alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
great . bye .
yes . i'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii .
and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing . that must be a great place . i can't miss it .
i know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
yes.bring me a bath towel as well .
can i make a reservation for flight fw58 to san marino ?
next monday .
what's the fare for a first class seat ?
yes , hello again . i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit .
and i can purchase that here ?
sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
that's easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me .
yes . it is very important to me . my mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and i know that t
yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
oh , thank you .
yes . i'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . please make the bed .
marry lin please .
all right , could i leave a message ?
well , that's what i'm looking for myself .
ok . let's go and see .
well , sir , i think i have made a mistake . i will take it back to the kitchen right now .
yes , sir . i'm really so sorry about that .
well . i ’ m sorry you feel that way .
want to go see a movie tonight ?
there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to !
i'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
you're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
promise that you won't get angry .
please , mummy . everybody else in my class keeps a pet . please , i'll take care of it . it's a good kitty . it'll not bring you any trouble .
please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it's so cute and tame .
i will . thank you , mummy .
sure , anything you say .
you need to know the type of shoes you want .
the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . in girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
well , everything really .
all right . but i don't want to play tennis . we played tennis last weekend .
i want to go jogging .
i am terribly sorry . you didn't come to reconfirm recently.you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west .
you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius ' preachings , right ?
any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ?
ok , will do .
what size do you want ?
how about this one ? it's the latest design .
i'm looking for a pair of shoes .
i wear size 36.this pair looks nice.can i try them on ?
how much are they ?
i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we will make wiser choices . what else did he tell you about it ?
ok , then we can sign up for it together .
no , we don't .
if you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
we put all of your test results up in the same place . just check the dates for what you need .
i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . how about meeting each other halfway ?
what would you suggest ?
listen , i am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . are we supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal of the avenue b bus or d bus ?
oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?
i cannot get hold of her yet .
we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
that's the best there is .
yes , please . we're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
what words ? can you tell me ?
honey , i don ’ t know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .
yes , i am james mason from anderson and associates . i would like to see mr . smith .
yes , he knows i'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
sure .
that would be very nice . thank you .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i don't think he won anything .
yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
being famous , i can do without , but i wouldn't mind being rich .
yes , i have known of it .
well , could you change them too ? the dollars , i want to change them into swiss francs .
it doesn't matter .
thanks a lot . good-bye .
that would be nice . how are you getting there ?
oh , i much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
which is more expensive ?
now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ?
they always make the front yards look so great for open houses . let ’ s see what the inside looks like .
signing the registry is a good idea . i think i want to see the kitchen next .
oh , madam , buy what ?
oh , oh , madam , madam , i'm afraid you have the wrong number .
no . i don't . i suggest you look in the phone book .
romantic ? i am afraid i like thrillers better .
on the contrary , very exciting .
what day was your appointment on ?
i am looking at your appointment right now . what day would you prefer ?
what time would be best for you ?
i am writing you down for that time . we look forward to seeing you .
hi , robert . this is janet reese calling from american advertising . we placed an order with you about a week ago .
well , it still hasn ’ t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
that's so great !
that's how much this t . v costs .
by how much ?
i'm sorry , but the price is final .
yes , i packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession .
not at all . go right ahead .
hold on a second please . i'm sorry . he has gone out .
he will be back at about seven o'clock .

i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ?
first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of
why didn ’ t we choose an office in the cbd ?
hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .

do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ?
what do you think about abortion ?
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
why not ? it's their children , too .
that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
but i don't have any reading assignments .
aw , mom-you're such a drag .
sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .
we will let you know probably next monday . i hope to give you a positive reply .
there are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
i would be happy to look at apartments with you .

i honestly didn't know .
of course i will .
thanks for letting me know .
but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake !
yes , i think i should have jumped in any case .
i know what you mean . i've started eating better myself .
i tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
nice to meet you too ! i am peter smith .
you are welcome .
yes , i used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
i mostly did advertising planning .
dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
no , i don't .
oh , do you ? good .
i'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
i can't . i'm waiting for paul , but he's late .
yeah , a number of times .
it's not even noon yet .
i am dying from the heat .
it doesn't work .
i don't know .
he's busy . he said next week .
i'll have another cup of beer insist . i know i don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
bottom's up , and you're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i'll be back agile soon .
well , i must apologize , madam . we have new computers here , you know .
i agree entirely . i assure you it won't happen again .
oh , yes , i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
no i don't but l do taijiquan or shadow boxing.people everywhere in china usually do taijiquan early in the morning.it can help people keep fit.it has a history of over three hundred years .
yes . it is i can teach you if you like .
who invented the electric light bulb ?

you bought a compact car ?
i love it . it's so festive ! and where did you get that cup ? it's got the same logo .
terrible ! does he want to divorce ?
don ’ t lose your reason . go to find him and talk with him .
you have much patience .
thank you . today i'm writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet .
no . i never sell my artwork .
i give it away . here , this one is for you .
remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
you see , this time i traveled to the west . when i looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone .
me too .
she does have a heart of gold .
you don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
of course it does ! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . i think most of the times they are just scam artists .
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
yes , i'd like a book about law .
next week ? it is too late . i need it urgently .
no , thanks any way .
what's up , robert ?
slow down . what are you talking about ?
what is your reservation number ?
i don't know . it's a rental .
sure , why not ?
well , i don't want it then . can i move to another pump ?
give me regular unleaded then . i will back up.can you wash my windows for me ?
really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .
oh no , thank you . we aren't all that thirsty .
each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
congratulation . what will you do ?
good . i'll do it .
i have no idea .
you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain .
you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird ... i've never seen one of those before . it's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky !
i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
aw , that's sweet ! i knew your costume would be a success .
yeah , i saw that . i thought you were playing a game with them .
of course i'd come . i couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better
definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there's a house-warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
same difference . what's this ?
i hope we'll get together again soon .
thank you .
but now you are rich .
well , i have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
that's a problem .
i don't know about that , but i do think that it helps people relax .
actually , i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ?
what kind of music do you prefer then ?
not really . i don't think pop music has much depth .
how long have you been in to pop music , then ?
not really . when i was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that's how it all started .
yes , it's one of my hobbies .
not good . my cousin is driving me up the wall .
not yet , but i have to soon . he's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night
this is no laughing matter , nick .
he watch the tob too much . now really i don't know . but i can't handle this much longer .
yes , that's right .
why don't you go to see the empire state building ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
that's a good idea . let's go !
cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
you forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
how can you be so sure ?
yes . are you going to be taking a class from him ?
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . good luck !
yeah , i know .
thank you , dear . i feel better now .
that sucks so much . what are we going to do ?
that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
ok . don't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime .
professor donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
i know , but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field .
oh , thanks , professor donald . this is really very nice of you .
come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! i ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
but , you two are on a break . theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
come on , hon . pull yourself together . it ’ s going to be alright .
you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...
do you hear something ?
to be honest , i was just dumped .
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
where is that ?
what's there to see ?
ok . then i can make up my mind .
yes , just once .
oh , i can't . i have a date !
yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
it's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
stay for dinner with us .
well , i won't keep you then . it was very nice of you to come to see me .
goodbye . thank you again for coming .
okay ...
what ? why ? i mean , we ’ ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?
so , what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ?
baby , come on . don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! don ’ t leave me .
laura ...
what's wrong , honey ? take it easy .
me too . but i think we can do something else for a change .
but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company .
perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
how about a training course ?
but it's worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
oh , yes . you ?
i thought it was better than the others-i really liked it . what did you think of it ?
mmm . that's what i thought too . i really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan .
not as much as last time , actually . what's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ?
yes !
i'm going to buy a cd .
then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
can you recommend some to me ?
i'll try it tonight .
he asked me how long it took me to learn english .
yeah , but i get that sometimes . it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
i told him 28 years . and , he knows i'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
yeah , i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english .
he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it's all good .
i sure do .
okay . now what ?
how am i supposed to log on to the computer ?
that ’ s it ? thank you very much .
to be honest , i'm really fed up with work at the moment . i need a break !
i have to work on saturday all day ! i really hate my job !
that'd be fantastic ! which beach are you going to ?
i can just use my beach towel . i love lazing around in the sun .
i can't wait ! it sounds like we're going to have a great time . how much money should i bring ?
why do you say that ? i think you're making a lot of progress .
learning any language takes a lot of effort.but don't give up . why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
you are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ?
ok , please .
i would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . it has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
how old are your children ?
yup , a big potluck buffet . and then-notice there are no children around ?
well , i've been looking forward to seeing you .
i'd love a gin and tonic .
sure , what's the author's name , please .
charles dickens ?
so , show me the note please .
oh , such bad luck , sir . can you please name the category of the book ?
ok , i'll search it for you . a moment , please .
i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
you can only miss one class without penalty .
i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
it sure is ! the water looks so nice ! anchor the boat for a little while . i ’ m going to take a dip .
it ’ s fine . jump in !
well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it wasn't actually that expensive .
i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .
not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
i'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
i can't . i'm waiting for paul , but he's late .
yeah , a number of times .
well , i own a house . actually , i ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i ’ m employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks ’ vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march .
well , i do have assets in my country . like i said , i own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
well , i am a bit out of shape . i'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
how can you get that done ?
what else ?
sounds pretty good . what about the charge ?
maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning .
not really . i could take it or leave it .
yes . it's nice to meet you too . are you a new student too ?
yeah . it's pretty exciting to be here .
i'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here .
that's pretty cool .
well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around .
ok .
who ?
and i ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it ’ s the third quarter and you ’ ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh no you didn ’ t . you didn ’ t just insult the sals-bury seals , did you ? why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing .
i just sense . but i cannot grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in-depth research before i send my application letters out .
certainly , it is very nice talking with you . but i really have to go now . catch you later .
he is more nice than wise .
sure.thank you very much .
yeah , i'm afraid so .
yes , it is annoying .
yes , of course . but i'm afraid i can't tell you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you , ms . smith . i ’ m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
what about gemini ? what's the prediction ?
that sounds bad ! i'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
that sounds great . where are you going ?
what should i bring ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
i guess we should invite him . i just hope he doesn't start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again .
yeah , you're right . we'll never hear the end of it .
personally , i'm not for it . i feel it's bad for kids to watch .
if you ask me , i have to disagree . something shouldn't be watched for fun .
do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
ok . i'll be happy to join you .
then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
yes .
i learned in college .
thank you .
3 weeks .
no . i've never been there .
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
they ’ re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
yes , it is . we've been dating for over 7 years . we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
yes , we called , but it is booked up . the only choice is the regent beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
thank you .
sorry , i thought you knew .
well , i'm telling you now .
yes . you've done a good job . but there's one thing . you should narrow down your topic .
i ’ m fine . thank you .
i need you to help me .
i get lost in this library .
thanks a lot for your help .
i'm very busy these days . it seems i can never finish my work .
i'll try . i'm under a lot of pressure right now .
i can't . i am really behind of my work .
at school . and i'm still learning it now .
about three years .
i'm afraid not .
god ! don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
they're really running you into the ground . why don't you ask for some time off ? you could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
you'd better pay more attention to your health .
you're welcome .
what happened ?
how did you find him at last ?
it must have taught you a lesson this time .
why should we run after the fashion ?
it can't be expressed by words .
wow , fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
that's right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it's just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
well , compared with my wife , i'm just a beginner .
what ? why do we have to do that ?
i see . that ’ s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
that ’ s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference , even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in la the same day at noon ! it ’ s like we went back in time !
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
you ’ re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what ’ s you favourite award category ?
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
my father lives in washington dc .
no , he's retired .
yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
nothing .
i ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
i hope so .
really ?
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm , ok ?
do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ?
what ? are you kidding ?
oh , uncle giovanni . that's wonderful ! thank you ! thank you !
i don't really like seeing bloody frames , but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
no , i didn't . and you ? was it good ?
how much was the ticket ?
do you think they'll become reconciled ?
to begin with , i have to use chopsticks .
certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch
anything strang about that ?
oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
don't be so angry . it's passed anyway .
you'd better cool yourself down first .
how many credits for each course ?
thank you , sir , i'm sure i will .
me too .
i meet too many jerks .
this city is full of jerks .
you mean you suspect him .
sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself .
it really depends on when and how long
but it won ’ t be on my birthday .
why ? they are fine .
indeed there are bad games . but many of them are good .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .
with pleasure . i suppose you dance often .
no . just occasionally .
ok .
yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
yes , i like to make new friends .
don't feel like it . i'm broke .
just look around ? nah , that ’ s boring .
great idea ! peter , i could use the drink .
excellent ! that sounds like a plan .
i've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . what about you ?
what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ?
me ? you're the one who pulled out in front of me !
hey , listen . i had every right to stay in the lane i was in.you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out.and anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.all of a sudden--bang--there you are right in front of me .
sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you're lucky you didn't get killed . and i'm lucky to be alive too .
fine with me . i know the laws of the road . i'm not worried .
alright .
oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time .
yes , maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone.don ' t move that arm while i'm gone . alright ?
yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must've finished remodeling . why do you want to know ?
that'd be wonderful , peter . but i hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
forget it . i'll see you at 11:30 am .
what's your excuse this time ?
yes , twice last week .
i don't think so . but it could've been .
i don't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . let's go out and get crazy tonight .
sure , but what do i wear ?
sounds great , i'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
ok , i will see you then .
good . i was thinking that i ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
all right.maybe next time i can go with you.bye !
maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?
congratulations . how lucky you are !
oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that's when i started to notice him .
absolutely . that's why when he entered the final , i was so excited .
and the host announced that he won it all !
hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .
it ’ s okay . i don ’ t want to go now . we ’ ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . i don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
it is in that brand new , tall building over there . on the 9th floor .
sure . glad to be of service . by the way , my name is mike sullivan . you will see me around a lot . i am running for president of the student government .
thanks you for the encouragement .
have a good day . bye-bye !
when is it ?
why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
congratulations !
ebay also offers free insurance . you can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .
thank you . i appreciate the compliment .
i just watched a movie and i'm scared .
if you're not busy , do you want to come over ? i'm afraid to be alone .
how about if we watch a comedy . i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense .
hurry , ok . it's dark out .
ok . see you soon .
i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides .
it's random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on , i may add several new entries in a week , and if i've got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
no , not yet . i ’ m still looking . i ’ ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
en ... it tastes good . i appreciate what you have done for me .
but we just drove across town . can't we just go in to see him one last ...
this is all too fast . he's my best friend , and now he's gone .
the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i didn't even get that .
he must be green . it ’ s lucky that we will get off soon .
now what are you doing ?
yes , i'm hungry . what types of food sound good ?
it's on the second floor . may i join you ?
let's hurry . i'm starving !
i want to go traveling .
yes , i've been thinking about florida .
sorry , i just worried about him . you know , he should be here an hour ago .
but he still does not come back .
for almost two years .
thank you . but there's still a lot for me to learn .
johnson ? i can't place them .
no , i don't recall a thing about them .
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
hey , isabelle ...
yes , i am the guy ...
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you ...
well , i'd like to , but i am not sure i have time .
all right , just a quick one .
certainly . jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong . his chinese name is cheng long .
ok . then tell me what else you know .
he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ?
indeed you know much about him .
oh , that's all right .
no , please don't . i couldn't let you do that .
yes , what's it ?
wait ! look at that board , what's on it ?
then we'd better not go .
not yet . i'm not finished with my research yet .
well , i really wanted to see the football game .
let me look in the tv guide first .
let's watch it together .
it was funny .
well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight .
we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan .
yes , you're right . and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back . my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
how do you know that ?
what do i do with it ?
so i don't have to worry about them .
i'll take home economics .
but i ... i don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
wow . i'd love to .
yes , i know . i appreciate your invitation .
i'm pretty tired these days .
i have so much house work to do . i have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ?
if he wasn't so lazy , i think i wouldn't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
oh well . i'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
that's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it .
oh , i didn't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
i want to travel .
the seaside .
i ’ ve been to qingdao before , so i ’ ll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good .
thank you !
thank you very much for your kindness .
oh , i ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there .
i think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
that ’ s my wish .
oh , yes , he is two years older than me . he lives in new zealand so i don't see him that often .
oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year and loved it .
my parents are already here . my brother and nephew are arriving on monday .
montreal .
we moved here when i was fourteen .
well , i went to high school here , but i went to college in texas .
no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france .
let's see ... that was about six years ago .
i studied french . anyway ... that's enough about me.how about you ? were you born in l . a . ?
yes , i'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
yes . he is very understanding and supportive .
let me give you a little advice . you know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ’ s easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
yeah . he's a private eye now .
i can't see it .
my invitation ? no , i haven't . my invitation to what ?
oh , they have ? i didn't know . i haven't seen tom lately .
is it nice ?
they are moving today . tom's taken the day off . he's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
next saturday night . you should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
i could go for that . but i'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ?
no need . i think it's still plenty full . even so , i'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
great ! oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . i'd hate to get caught in the rain .
me , too . now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
sounds good . where are we going ?
need a new . girlfriend , huh ?
whew ! that getup is terrific !
hold on ! what's the big hurry ?
i wanna finish my drink first . i'll meet you at sammy's .
ha ha , come on ! well , i ’ ve been watching what i eat , and working out three times a week . by the way , i heard your son recently graduated !
he is such a handsome guy . he gets his looks from his mother of course !
oh yes . she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended .
but of course ! well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but i have to get going .
that would be great ! give me a call !
yeah . it was hard . when do you take it ?
mostly on the civil war . you should also study the impact martin luther king jr . had on american society .
i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
if you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
good luck .
it's us .
oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
back to live with my parents . that's something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
really ? i've never heard that before . i just like it .
pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
i didn't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
sometimes , but these days i'm often too busy .
most people were living form hand to mouth . how could they ?
fortunately , things are changing these years .
a friend and i are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
i am afraid i can't i am going to be out all day .
i am really sorry too , maybe i can give you a call sometime .
sure . but , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . have you been hiking before ?
wow ! you must have been pretty far away from the city .
i don't know if anything terrible has happened .
we'd better prepare for the worst .
oh ...
sorry , love .
yes , i do . but my characters are very bad .
are you chinese by birth ?
how do you like it ?
i want to study mandarin and public relations .
sure . it's probably a skiing show . adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
two , i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
how in the world ! who came up with seats like that from your company ?
what are we waiting for ? let's go !
ok ! how about scrabble ?
ok !
our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
it bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .
for instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
good news ! and congratulations !
thank you . i'll certainly be there .
definitely . but i think it is too fierce .
sure , but let's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close .
it's all the way to the back . see that yellow door ?
you're back already . that sure was quick .
well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . anyway . he said it was too close to closing time .
okay , let's go !
well , i spend a lot of time watching movies .
oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ?
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon .
it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i've got a membership there .
yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
why not ?
really ? that's so great . congratulations .
that's really exciting . how many months are you pregnant ?
maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .
it really must be an exciting time for you guys .
unbelievable ! how do people go through it ?
much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .
so sorry . next time we'll go , thanks anyway .
thank you for your inition . i'm free tonight .
if that happen to me , i ’ ll take them back to the shop .
that ’ s terrible . but if they wouldn ’ t change them , i know what i would do .
of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
can i help you ?
i ’ ll be glad to help .
i ’ m ready and willing to help .
maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking . i hear there's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses . are you interested ?
you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
i couldn't do that . i have an important meeting to go to today .
not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i've got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i've also got the flu .
could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?
ok . i'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i'm going to the meeting .
i don't know . it looks a bit red , but i'm sure it's nothing .
just cats , but i don't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting !
that's too bad .
you know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
not much , usually i'll just keep silent .
not yet .
cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
you forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
okay . keep in touch .
i ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .
yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .
i know why we have reservations .
but we do have a compact or an suv if you ’ d like .
no , i think harry will get it .
ok , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . now , i know the answer .
to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .
didn't you hear ? he was disqualified .
if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
i wish you had been my history teacher ! i might have got better marks !
what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice , do they ?
i see . i think i ’ d agree with that statement . people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
you , too .
it isn't that easy . i hate to quit my present job . people around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
yes , they say i would get a big sum .
i have to think about it .
that ’ s great . he ’ s the best runner i ’ ve seen this season . i ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the olympics .
i really don ’ t know . i don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
i may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .
i will , do you want me to bring anything ?
it's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
i haven't played chess for a long time .
look , there's a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing .
not really , but once i won a prize .
my prize was for the best player in the country . now let's start playing chess seriously .
yeah , about .
oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
i mean , i understand that . but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
i am not exaggerating at all . i ’ m telling you the truth . that was how i felt at that time .
yes , absolutely true .
harry potter .
it's really a good book . you will like it too .
wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who's your favorite writer ?
thanks , tim.nice meeting you , too .
ye , i hope so.well.take it easy .
i've had it with tim ! i think i'm going to quit !
yeah ... i know . but i'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort .
what is it ? what happened ?
what did you do ?
did he leave when you left ?
what did you do ?
yes , i know a great place . what types of food do you like ?
that's right . why do you ask ?
when are you getting married ?
congratulations ! i had no idea .
do you like amusement parks ?
even those . it'll be very romantic , i think . you'll have loads of fun .
i'm sure he'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ?
i'll ask mrs . thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ?
yeah . dig my new pants ?
no . mine are a soft brown . yours are khaki .
well.good for him .
i think the supermarket is closed now .
don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8: 00 .
let's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8: 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner .
she lives in san francisco .
i think she's lived there for about 10 years .
san diego .
no . how about you ?
what did you argue about ?
well , he should pay you back . it ’ s only fair .
well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it ’ s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
of course you should . you wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
i don ’ t think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
yes . dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . they are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
they are . i read a story about a dolphin saving a a from drowning in the sea .
they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
no , i wouldn't think so .
well , why don't you go on the diet ?
perhaps you should excercise more . why don't you go to an exercise class .
all right .
really ?
it is a new park , isn't it ?
i guessed it .
oh , how wonderful !
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation .
of course ! make yourself at home .
can you tell her to come downstairs ? we're about to have dinner .
well . good for him .
if we hurry , can we get there in time ?
yes , and it's great . what are the events at the sports meeting ?
the competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .
how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles !
aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
yes , i ’ m a singer .
george , how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .
where will we sleep , then ?
maybe you ’ re right . when do you plan to go ?
let ’ s go to chicago.we can have lunch in chinatown.then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
the science field trip is next monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
next monday is december 2nd . the buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7
you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th . do you have a ride ?
my boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . i didn't know you were working here.what a surprise.how long have you been doing this ?
do you enjoy work here ?
take it easy . i'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
glad to hear that .
you mean with people on it ?
sorry , i thought you knew .
well , i am telling you now .
sorry , i didn't think it mattered .
i didn't really like it .
where are you going ?
again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
why ? i don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
yeah , sounds like something i should definitely do .
very well too , thank you very much.isn ' t it a lovely day ?
yes .
in london.where do you live ?
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
no . why don't you check out the newspaper ?
oh , come on . that ’ s such a girl ’ s show .
yeah , if you ’ re a girl .
o . k . , o . k . let ’ s forget it . there ’ s a football game on too .
what are you talking about ?
you said it . many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
yes , i bought a few things .
at the mall on 5th street .
no , it wasn't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars .
i know . it was a really good deal .
oh , i'm fine .
maybe ... but i don't think so .
now that's a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i'm feeling better already .
no way , if it still has 21 .
it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day .
wow , i can't catch my breath . you are running too fast , honey .
yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing !
but running so fast is not good for people over forties .
oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they're so scary .
it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
maybe . after all , i am grown up now .
the economy has been stagnant for a while now . we've been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports .
it's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? if unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . that would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .
that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
my mother works in a company as an accountant .
i'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . i've asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . i hope you'll like them .
now let me sing " happy birthday " for you .
i don't want to .
certainly not .
turn on the tv for what ?
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner , will you ?
to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate it .
brian ! how have you been ?
i'm doing really well . i got married about three years ago . i have two kids now .
no , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
well , i swim and run every day .
well , i don't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
we rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . it was very exciting .
well , you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb .
o . k . see you .
i can speak german quite well , but i can't speak french very well .
you're such a wimp ! you're afraid of an eyelash curler .
yes . i'm afraid so .
oh . well , it can't be helped .
that's terrible !
you see ? every cloud has a silver lining .
actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch .
thank you so much .
this one is $ 1500 . but they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
yeah . i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
not very well .
nothing .
well , you're right . i just broke up with jane .
well , you never know . i'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
maybe you're right .
yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . you know , we were together for almost five years . it's really hard ...
oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock-out . she devotes much of her time to her career .
my watch is a few minutes fast . it's about six forty , i think .
if we start now , we can make it by taxi .
yeah .
the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options . but bob didn't want to play that game again .
is this the sign ? what does it says ?
sure . take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories . readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met . most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
thank you . let met sign it for you ... there you go .
oh , you may call him uncle , or henry .
that's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
will it be an all day event ?
that was quick thinking .
cool ! flashy red lines !
is it waterproof ?
uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
yeah , everyday . and there ’ s only one choice . all the other buses are going the other direction .
oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
hmm . good exercise , uh ?
what do you think ? i ’ m a good boy .
yeah , they all received very strict training . a minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
that's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games .
my little boy , you should learn more from me . i'm almost thirty years older than you .
oh , my god . it's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you mustn't do anything like that .
he is hopeless .
not bad.we have had a big meeting today , remember ?
pretty well . i think the boss liked my ideas .
are you stupid ? they are called ufos , so not everybody can see them .
no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
ok , ok , one by one , please ! they look like robots , but they can speak . their mission is to make friends with human beings .
of course in english , they learn english on mars too .
yes . i ’ ve won the first prize in the math contest .
good , happy birthday to you !
sure , i will . thank you for inviting me .
sure . what's up ?
yes , that's right . that's the poster of the the witch .
did it scare you ?
boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
i like scary movies .
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you .
do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
my domicile place is hebes province .
he's going to turn six next month .
yeah , i know .
yes , quite a bit . how about a game sometime ?
paris is a beautiful city . i have never been there . have you ever been there , ken ?
paris in the spring , eh ?
just like dear old london !
that give us a good lesson .
i'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
you know how hard i've tried to give up drinking ? i ’ d be lost without you . i won ’ t let you go anyway .
nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . the drought in africa is causing starvation . millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
how time flies ! i'll not see twenty again .
yes , i'm now working in a company .
oh , i ’ m afraid i can ’ t . i ’ ve had a date already .
may be some other time .
give it here .
they didn ’ t accept me .
it ’ s the truth .
i really wanted to get into nyu .
yeah .
you've been through this too ?
but it hurts too much .
what if i don't want to find another girl ?
you're right .
yeah . thanks for the talk .
ok . i'll talk to you later .
you are right . we shouldn't do anything under the table .
can't elvin handle it ?
how nice of you to say so .
yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
whoa , take it easy there rambo . don ’ t get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
i ’ m fine . i ’ ve been out of town . i just got back .
i was in new york for a wedding .
don't feel like it . i'm broke .
just look around ? ah , that's boring .
i don't know . my life is a big mess . everything is so complicated .
but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
i've fallen in love with my boss .
no , of course not . he is still single .
worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
oh , nothing special . i'm just a bit tired .
it wasn't always like this , you know .
hey , isabelle ...
yes , i am the guy .
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you ...
i'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
well , i swim and run every day .
well , i don't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
yeah .
i wouldn't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
maybe you're right , but i'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
what do you mean ?
yes , look over there . that's the empire state building . my book says it's 102 stories tall .
nothing that serious . she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
what do you mean ?
i guess so . better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
yeah , you can count on it .
i like him . he's good for her .
whatever things get tough , he gives in .
oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss.parker speaks to us only in english .
not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss.parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen .
the lakers . jordan is the only good player washington has .
it's ok . what do you want to ask ?
the first place you should go is the international center .
they'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student id and social security number there . they will keep your documents up-to-date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office .
besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
is that inflation ?
how ?
sounds a good idea .
you shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . that's a foul .
you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding .
just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
certainly . what's the matter ?
sure . i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
that's simple . just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
no . it's free .
it ’ s so cool !
i ’ m afraid this seat is taken .
alps , suppose .
is he really ?
who is he marring ?
mam , another minute , could i ?
yes , i like collecting things .
yes , stones .
mary told me that she had seen you with john last night . i got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
hey , darling , i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . how time flies !
are you kidding ? can you afford it ? do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
yeah , i think so .
wonderful ! i'll start packing our suitcases .
